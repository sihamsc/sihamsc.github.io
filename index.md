I’m a London-based **Data Scientist** with 10+ years of experience across marketing, pricing and customer analytics.  
I like turning messy real-world data into **models, experiments and dashboards** that actually change decisions.

## 🧠 What I work with

- **Machine learning:** classification, regression, uplift / propensity, churn & lapse models  
- **Analytics:** marketing attribution, funnels, cohort analysis, experimentation & A/B testing  
- **Data stack:** SQL · Python · R · dbt · Power BI / dashboards  
- **Way of working:** end-to-end – from problem framing and data design to communicating results to stakeholders

## 🚀 Selected Projects

*(Placeholders for now – I’ll keep adding real links + write-ups.)*

### 📌 Project 1 – [Title of Your First Project]

**Short one-liner:** What was the business problem and what did you solve?

- **Goal:** e.g. predict which customers are likely to lapse / churn  
- **Approach:** e.g. feature engineering on behavioural & policy data, trained LightGBM/XGBoost, model explainability with SHAP  
- **Impact:** e.g. improved targeting for retention campaigns, higher ROI on save offers

### 📌 Project 2 – [Title of Your Second Project]

**Short one-liner:** e.g. “Analysed user behaviour around a major sales event (Prime Day) to understand funnels & uplift.”

- **Goal:** understand how users browse, click and convert across the funnel  
- **Approach:** clickstream analysis, funnel drop-off, segmentation, uplift vs control  
- **Impact:** informed which segments to retarget and which journeys to optimise

### 📌 Project 3 – [Title of Your Third Project]

**Short one-liner:** e.g. “End-to-end face recognition pipeline for photo organisation.”

- **Goal:** automatically detect, embed and group faces across large photo collections  
- **Approach:** used `dlib` / `face_recognition` / `OpenCV` for detection & embeddings, clustering, duplicate detection  
- **Impact:** faster search / de-duplication and a reusable pipeline for future projects

### 📌 Project 4 – [Title of Your Fourth Project]

**Short one-liner:** e.g. “Pricing / optimisation project, demand modelling, or experimentation.”

- **Goal:** describe the business question in 1 line  
- **Approach:** key modelling / analytical techniques used  
- **Impact:** what changed, who used it, any measurable result

### 📌 Project 5 – [Title of Your Fifth Project]

**Short one-liner:** e.g. “Dashboard or data product to make a recurring analysis self-serve.”

- **Goal:** what decision did this dashboard / tool support?  
- **Approach:** data modelling, metrics definition, visual design choices  
- **Impact:** who uses it, how often, what decisions it enabled

## 👤 About me

I’ve spent my career sitting between **data, marketing and product teams** – translating business questions into
data problems, and model outputs back into decisions non-technical stakeholders care about.

Things I care about:

- Clear problem framing before touching a model  
- Simple baselines and experiments before “fancy” modelling  
- Reproducible code and documentation so work isn’t a black box  
- Honest communication about uncertainty, trade-offs and limitations
